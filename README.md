**Senior Software Engineer | Web & AI | 16+ yrs | 150+ projects**

I’m **Adriano Junior**, a senior software engineer and digital nomad with **16+ years** building fast, reliable web apps and practical AI features for teams across **15+ countries**. I combine product thinking with hands-on engineering so things ship quickly—and stay solid in production.

## What I’m great at
- **MVPs in weeks:** From concept to live product with clean architecture, strong tests, and a smooth dev onboarding.
- **Performance that matters:** API refactors and caching/DB tuning that have delivered **~80% latency reductions** (e.g., ~3s → ~300ms).
- **Complex integrations:** **40+ payment flows** (processors, banks, wallets), third-party APIs, and event-driven microservices.
- **Leadership that ships:** Roadmaps, code reviews, delivery rituals, and mentoring—without slowing down execution.
- **Practical AI:** User-visible features (explanations, summarization, assistants) using OpenAI/Claude that actually move KPIs.

## What I build
- **Websites & Webapps** that are fast, secure, and maintainable  
- **APIs & Microservices** with clear contracts, metrics, and observability  
- **AI features** that enhance UX and reduce support load  
- **Cloud & DevOps** on **AWS** with **Docker/Kubernetes**, CI/CD, and IaC
