**Senior Software Engineer, CTO, Team Leader and Entrepreneur since 2009**

With over 15 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, I’ve built a career defined by a passion for creating impactful, high-performance digital solutions. Originally from Brazil, I began working in tech in 2009 and have since transitioned to life as a digital nomad, blending my work with travel across Latin America and Europe. Living and working in countries like Argentina, Portugal, Belgium, and Spain has given me a unique perspective on global markets, user needs, and the nuances of international collaboration.

I specialize in crafting robust, scalable systems optimized for performance and cost-effectiveness. My projects include high-traffic platforms, real estate portals, and e-commerce applications where I’ve leveraged tools like Laravel, React, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure on AWS. Recently, I built a real estate platform that combined Meilisearch and Pulumi to deliver fast, reliable search experiences at scale. These hands-on experiences have taught me how to balance technical goals with strategic business outcomes, and I approach every project with a focus on delivering real value.

My understanding of economics further enriches my approach. Knowing how economic forces affect business decisions allows me to create tech solutions that support both growth and efficiency. Working remotely and in diverse cultural settings has sharpened my adaptability and problem-solving skills, making me an asset to teams that value flexibility and resilience.

I’m always open to connecting with others in tech, whether you’re looking to explore ideas on remote work, scaling web applications, or optimizing infrastructure. If you’re interested in meaningful, practical insights on creating global-ready digital solutions, feel free to follow along and reach out—I’m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and share knowledge.
