<h1 align='center'>I'm Adriano üë®‚Äçüíª</h1>

<h3 align='center'>
  A <i>Brazilian</i> Senior PHP Laravel Developer
</h3>

13 years of experience with full stack web development working in the most diverse projects of small, medium and large sizes in Brazil, USA, Europe and Asia.

I am currently a <a href='https://laravel.com/'>Laravel developer</a> (backend) at <a href='https://tinkerlist.tv/'>Tinkerlist</a> (a TV production software company) and as a development manager at <a href='https://reworkdevs.com/'>Rework IT</a> (ondemand software development).

I started my career with PHP (in 2009) and in 2015 I started to adopt the <a href='https://laravel.com/'>Laravel Framework</a> in all projects.

I'm passionate about performing upgrades, mapping improvements, solving performance issues, rewriting codes and creating POC's (Prove of Concepts) to test new approaches, in addition to assiduously following the releases of <a href='https://laravel.com/'>Laravel ecosystem</a> products and new versions of <a href='https://www.php.net/'>PHP</a>.

I'm Brazilian and I've been living in Portugal since 2020. I'm also an enthusiast of remote work, as I've been working this way since 2017.
