I’m a Senior Software Engineer, former CTO, and Team Leader with 16+ years of experience driving innovation and growth since 2009 ￼. Originally from Brazil and having worked across Latin America and Europe as a digital nomad, I bring a unique global perspective to my work ￼. Now as a freelancer, I specialize in building robust, scalable web systems optimized for performance and cost-effectiveness ￼.

My projects have ranged from high-traffic platforms and real estate portals to e-commerce applications, using technologies like Laravel (PHP), React, Node.js, and AWS ￼. I pride myself on delivering solutions that are both high-quality and fast to market: for example, I built a startup’s MVP in just three weeks ￼ and later improved another platform’s API performance by 80% through optimization ￼. Backed by a background in economics and leadership, I ensure that technical decisions align with business goals ￼, creating scalable systems that drive growth efficiently.

I’m always open to connecting with others in tech, whether you want to discuss remote work, scaling web applications, or optimizing infrastructure – feel free to reach out ￼.
