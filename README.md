I’ve spent the last 16 years building software and solving technical problems for over 250 different projects. My approach is pretty straightforward: I focus on building things that work, shipping them on time, and making sure they are easy to maintain. I’m not big on buzzwords or hype; I just enjoy the craft of engineering and helping people turn their ideas into stable products.

Most of my day-to-day work involves taking a founder's vision and getting a production-ready MVP live in a matter of weeks, or diving into legacy systems to fix bottlenecks and make them feel snappy again. I also spend a lot of time integrating AI into products, but only in ways that actually make sense for the user, like simplifying tasks or automating repetitive work.

I work as a solo freelancer because I prefer a direct connection with the people I’m building for. When you work with me, you’re getting 16 years of hands-on experience without the layers of project managers or unnecessary meetings. If you’re looking for someone to help with a launch or to clean up a complex system, you can see my work and get in touch through my website at [adriano-junior.com](https://adriano-junior.com).
