**Senior Software Engineer, CTO, Team Leader and Entrepreneur since 2009**

I live around the world and speak fluent English, Portuguese and Spanish. I have a preference for 100% remote work.

I'm Brazilian, originally from Santa Catarina. Since 2020, I've been living as a digital nomad, which has allowed me to pursue my passion for travel. I've had the opportunity to explore several countries in Latin America and Europe, enriching my perspective and experiences.

Beyond my professional interests in technology, I have a deep fascination with Economics. I enjoy studying economic theories and their real-world applications, which often provides valuable insights that complement my work in the tech industry.

My journey as a digital nomad has not only broadened my cultural understanding but also enhanced my adaptability and problem-solving skills, which I bring to every project I undertake.
