<h1 align='center'>I'm Adriano üë®‚Äçüíª</h1>

<h3 align='center'>
  A <i>Brazilian</i> Senior PHP Laravel Developer
</h3>

With 14 years of experience in full stack web development, I have honed my skills working on a wide range of projects of varying sizes across multiple countries including Brazil, USA, Europe and Asia. As a Laravel developer at <a href="https://tinkerlist.tv/">Tinkerlist</a>, a software company for television production, and development manager at <a href="https://tinkerlist.tv/">Rework IT</a>, an on-demand software development company, I bring a wealth of experience to each project I take on.

I am currently also serving as the CTO at <a href="https://tinkerlist.tv/">Imohub</a>, the largest real estate marketplace in southern Brazil. My expertise in the field of web development and my passion for staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology have made me an invaluable asset to the team.

I first started my career with PHP in 2009 and since then, I have adopted the <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel Framework</a> in all my projects. My love for performing upgrades, mapping improvements, and solving performance problems drives me to constantly strive for excellence in my work. I also take great pride in preparing POC's (Prove of Concepts) to test new approaches, as well as staying abreast of the latest releases in the Laravel ecosystem and new versions of PHP.

I am a Brazilian digital nomad, travelling with my wife and daughter, and I am a strong advocate of remote work. I have been working remotely since 2017 and have found it to be a highly rewarding and fulfilling way of life.

Overall, I am a dedicated and knowledgeable professional with a passion for web development. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my expertise and make a positive impact in my field.
